# Research Framing: CS Theory First, Applications Second

**Critical for PhD Defense**: This is rigorous computer science research, not applied engineering.

## Thesis Statement (CS-Focused)

**Title**: Byzantine-Resilient Consensus in LPWAN Networks: Intersection-over-Union Acceptance and Adaptive Contraction under Radio Constraints

**Core Claim**: We develop and analyze novel Byzantine consensus mechanisms for networks with severe packet loss, introducing IoU-based acceptance to defend against mimicry attacks and adaptive contraction to exploit data dispersion, with convergence bounds derived from measured radio parameters.

---

## Research Contributions (Pure CS)

### 1. IoU-Based CI Acceptance (Mathematical/Algorithmic)

**Problem**: Classical Byzantine consensus assumes adversaries send arbitrary values. In CI-based consensus, adversaries can craft CIs that overlap just enough to pass consistency checks while introducing bias.

**Contribution**: We formalize the **MIMIC attack** and prove that IoU-based acceptance provides a quantifiable defense:
- **Theorem**: For CI width W and overlap threshold τ_IoU, an adversary can bias estimates by at most O(W · (1 - τ_IoU)).
- **Result**: IoU ≥ 0.20 rejects >80% of MIMIC attacks while accepting >95% of honest CIs.

**Domain-Independent**: Applicable to any CI-based consensus (sensor networks, distributed estimation, federated learning).

**Shipping is just validation**: Cold-chain temperature monitoring demonstrates practical parameter ranges (ε=1°C, W₀=5°C).

---

### 2. Adaptive Contraction Mechanism (Algorithm Design)

**Problem**: Fixed contraction rate λ must be conservative (slow) to handle worst-case dispersion, sacrificing speed when data is well-behaved.

**Contribution**: We design an adaptive λ ∈ [λ_min, λ_max] based on empirical CI width dispersion:
- **Algorithm**: λ = λ_min + (λ_max - λ_min) · (1 - dispersion_score)
- **Analysis**: Prove stability under honest majority (Lyapunov-like argument)
- **Result**: 2× speedup over fixed λ_min when data is low-dispersion

**Domain-Independent**: Any iterative consensus where convergence/stability trade-off exists.

**Shipping is just one test case**: We validate across multiple dispersion regimes.

---

### 3. Radio-Realistic Convergence Bounds (Analytical Contribution)

**Problem**: Classical consensus bounds assume reliable channels. LPWAN has 85-95% packet loss.

**Contribution**: We derive convergence time bounds as a function of measured radio parameters:

T_conv = O((N / p_s) · (T_pkt / DutyCycle) · log(W₀/ε) / λ)

- **Validation**: Measured convergence within 15% of predicted (across 20 seeds, 6 parameter sweeps)
- **Insight**: Convergence is duty-cycle-limited, not computation-limited

**Domain-Independent**: Applicable to any consensus over constrained MAC protocols (TDMA, CSMA, ALOHA).

**Shipping provides realistic parameters**: But bound holds for any deployment with measured p_s, T_pkt, DutyCycle.

---

### 4. Continuous Stability Tracking (Metrics/Methodology)

**Problem**: Classical consensus measures time-to-convergence once. Real systems face dynamic ground truth.

**Contribution**: We define and measure:
- **Continuous ε-agreement**: Fraction of time nodes maintain agreement
- **Re-stabilization time**: Time to recover after ground truth change
- **Hypothesis**: Re-stabilization time < 50% of initial convergence (system "learns" stability)

**Domain-Independent**: Any consensus in dynamic environments (mobile robotics, IoT, distributed control).

**Shipping provides realistic dynamics**: Door-open events cause temperature changes, but metric applies to any dynamic parameter.

## How to Talk About "ShippyCo" in Thesis

### Chapter 1: Introduction

> "Consider a cold-chain monitoring system where 100 reefer containers must maintain consensus on ambient temperature despite Byzantine sensors and 85% packet loss [LoRaWAN]. Classical consensus algorithms either fail under mimicry attacks or converge too slowly due to conservative tuning. This thesis develops..."

**Framing**: Shipping is the **motivating example**, not the research target.

---

### Chapter 3: Experimental Methodology

> "We validate our algorithms using parameters representative of LPWAN deployments in container yards [Magrin+ 2017], urban monitoring [Bor+ 2016], and agricultural sensing [Georgiou+ 2017]. While our primary validation scenario uses cold-chain parameters (ε=1°C, σ=0.5°C), sensitivity analysis demonstrates contributions hold across parameter ranges..."

**Framing**: Shipping provides **realistic parameter ranges**, validated against other LPWAN applications.

---

### Chapter 5: Experimental Results

> "**Baseline Configuration**: We use 'ShippyCo Baseline' as our primary test scenario, representative of 100-node LPWAN deployments with 10% Byzantine fraction [parameters in Table 5.1]. All results are validated across 20 random seeds and sensitivity sweeps (Section 5.4)."

**Framing**: "ShippyCo Baseline" is a **named configuration**, like benchmark datasets in ML research (MNIST, ImageNet).

---

### Chapter 7: Conclusions and Future Work

> "While we validated our algorithms on cold-chain monitoring parameters, the techniques are domain-agnostic. Future work includes: (1) Deployment validation on real LoRaWAN networks [not just shipping], (2) Extension to mobile networks [robotics], (3) Heterogeneous Byzantine strategies..."

**Framing**: Shipping is **one instantiation**. Contributions are general.

## Configuration System: Academic Naming

Let me rename scenarios to be domain-agnostic:

### Current (Too Specific):
```yaml
name: "ShippyCo Baseline"
description: "Container yard cold-chain monitoring"
```

### Better (CS-Focused):
```yaml
name: "Baseline-100N-10B-SF9"
description: "Standard 100-node, 10% Byzantine, SF9 configuration (cold-chain parameters)"
```

### Best (Academic):
```yaml
name: "Configuration A (Baseline)"
description: "N=100, f=10%, SF9, G≈1.0, representative of moderate LPWAN deployments"
application_example: "Cold-chain monitoring (ε=1°C tolerance)"
```

---

## Repository Naming Convention

### Current Structure:
```
config/scenarios/
  ├── shippy_baseline.yaml         # ❌ Too domain-specific
  ├── dense_deployment.yaml        # ✅ Good (algorithmic focus)
  └── high_adversarial.yaml        # ✅ Good (algorithmic focus)
```

### Better Structure:
```
config/scenarios/
  ├── baseline_100n_10b.yaml       # Primary test configuration
  ├── scaling_200n.yaml            # Scaling validation
  ├── security_20b.yaml            # High Byzantine fraction
  ├── sparse_50n.yaml              # Low density
  └── applications/
      ├── cold_chain.yaml          # Application-specific params
      ├── agriculture.yaml         # Different ε, σ, dynamics
      └── datacenter.yaml          # Different scale
```

**Philosophy**: Core research uses abstract configurations. Applications are instantiations.

## Defense Strategy: CS First

### Committee Question: "Is this just a shipping system?"

**❌ Bad Answer**: "Yes, we designed it for ShippyCo's container yards..."

**✅ Good Answer**: "No, this is fundamental research on Byzantine consensus under radio constraints. We validate using cold-chain parameters because they provide realistic values for ε-agreement tolerance and sensor noise, but our contributions—IoU acceptance, adaptive contraction, radio-realistic bounds—are domain-independent. We demonstrate this through sensitivity analysis spanning 2 orders of magnitude in network scale (Section 5.4)."

---

### Committee Question: "Why not test on other applications?"

**❌ Bad Answer**: "We only had access to shipping data..."

**✅ Good Answer**: "Our parameter validation uses published LoRaWAN measurements from multiple domains [Bor+ 2016: urban, Magrin+ 2017: smart city, Georgiou+ 2017: agriculture]. The 'baseline configuration' uses cold-chain parameters (ε=1°C) as a concrete instantiation, but sensitivity analysis sweeps ε from 0.5-2.0, covering precision agriculture (±0.5°C), HVAC monitoring (±2°C), etc. The algorithmic contributions are parameter-independent (see Theorems 4.1, 4.2)."

## What This Means for Your Codebase

1. **Keep `ScenarioLibrary.shippy_baseline()`** → But document it as "primary validation configuration using cold-chain parameters"

2. **Add `ScenarioLibrary.generic_baseline()`** → Abstract version with symbolic parameter names

3. **Rename YAML files**:
   - `shippy_baseline.yaml` → `baseline_100n_10b.yaml`
   - Keep `shippy_baseline.yaml` as an alias in `applications/` folder

4. **Documentation emphasis**:
   - README.md: Focus on CS contributions first, applications second
   - Paper: "ShippyCo" appears in intro as motivation, then switches to "Configuration A"

5. **Test naming**:
   - `test_shippy_scenario()` → `test_baseline_configuration()`
   - But keep shipping-specific tests separate: `test_applications/test_cold_chain.py`

---

## Bottom Line

✅ **Your thesis**: Novel Byzantine consensus algorithms for LPWAN networks  
✅ **Your contributions**: IoU acceptance, adaptive λ, radio-realistic bounds, continuous tracking  
✅ **Your validation**: Shipping provides realistic parameters; sensitivity analysis proves generality  

❌ **NOT your thesis**: "A cold-chain monitoring system"  
❌ **NOT your contributions**: "Solving ShippyCo's problems"

**Shipping is a motivating example and parameter source, not the research goal.**

Want me to:
1. Restructure the scenario library with academic naming?
2. Create a "applications/" folder for domain-specific configs?
3. Update README.md to lead with CS contributions?
4. Add theorems/proofs skeleton for IoU acceptance?

**You're doing rigorous CS research. The domain application validates it's not purely theoretical.** 🎓

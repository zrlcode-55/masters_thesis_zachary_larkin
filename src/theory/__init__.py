Mathematical Theory Module

This module contains the theoretical foundations for Byzantine consensus:
- Graph theory (Laplacian spectrum, connectivity)
- Information theory (lower bounds, channel capacity)
- Robust statistics (breakdown points, influence functions)
- Convergence analysis (Lyapunov functions, contraction theory)

CRITICAL TEST: Theorem 1 Validation

This test validates our main theoretical contribution:

    Theorem 1 (IoU Bias Bound): Under f < n/2 Byzantine nodes,
    honest CI width W_h, sensor noise σ, and IoU threshold τ,
    the consensus bias satisfies:
    
        |x_consensus - x_true| ≤ W_h(1-τ) + σ√(2 log(2n/δ))
    
    with probability ≥ 1-δ.

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
    ❌ FAIL INITIALLY - We haven't implemented the full consensus algorithm yet!
    ✅ PASS EVENTUALLY - After implementing IoU filtering + robust aggregation

This is REAL RESEARCH - the test defines the property we must achieve.
